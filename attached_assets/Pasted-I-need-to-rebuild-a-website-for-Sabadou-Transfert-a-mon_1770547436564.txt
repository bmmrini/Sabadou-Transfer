I need to rebuild a website for Sabadou Transfert, a money transfer company 
operating in Guinea. The current site (sabadouservices.com) is outdated and 
built on Joomla. I want to create a modern, professional website from scratch.

ABOUT THE BUSINESS:
- Service: Domestic money transfer across Guinea (person-to-person)
- Coverage: All 33 prefectures in Guinea with 375+ physical agency locations
- Key selling points: No bank account needed, fast transfers (minutes), 
  transparent fees, 99% customer satisfaction
- Target audience: Guinean diaspora sending money home + local users within Guinea
- Languages needed: French (primary) and English

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Modern, responsive design (mobile-first)
- Fast loading speed
- Clean, professional look that builds trust
- Need these key features:
  1. Fee calculator (user inputs amount, sees exact transfer cost)
  2. Agency finder (searchable/filterable list of 375+ locations)
  3. Multi-language support (FR/EN toggle)
  4. Blog section
  5. Contact forms

DESIGN DIRECTION:
- Professional but warm and approachable
- Colors: Currently uses orange/yellow branding (open to suggestions)
- Must convey: Security, Speed, Simplicity
- Inspiration: Modern fintech sites like Wise, Remitly, but simpler
- Avoid: Corporate banking feel - too cold
- Target: Trustworthy yet accessible to non-tech-savvy users

CURRENT WEBSITE PROBLEMS TO AVOID:
- Outdated Joomla template look
- Poor typography and spacing
- Unclear call-to-actions
- Important features buried in navigation
- Typos and language inconsistencies
- No clear user flow

PRIORITY PAGES TO BUILD:
1. Homepage (most important - clear value prop, how it works, CTA)
2. Fee Calculator page
3. Agency Finder page
4. About Us
5. Contact

Let's start with the HOMEPAGE. I want a modern, conversion-focused design that 
immediately communicates what Sabadou does and why users should trust them.

Can you help me create the structure and initial code for this homepage?
